# BarNone (originally SignalScape)
This project will develop a live, crowdsourced map of wireless dead zones (WiFi, LTE, 5G) and detect potential ISP throttling. Users will contribute network performance data through a mobile app. Clustering algorithms will analyze this data to pinpoint areas with poor connectivity and identify potential throttling patterns.
